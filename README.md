# FLACSFX: FLAC SelF-eXtracting archive
FLACSFX builds a minimal FLAC-to-WAV transcoder with an embedded FLAC byte stream. To use, simply place a FLAC file into the repository's root directory and execute the `Build.cmd`. When the resultant application is executed, it will transcode the embedded FLAC byte stream to a WAV file. This allows you to quickly and easily send losslessly compressed FLAC audio to someone who needs it as a WAV in order to reduce the file size in transit and increase transfer speeds, while also not requiring any technical know-how on the part of the recipient.
